    The stuff normally here has been put in applicationContext.xml; since we only have one servlet
    there's no need to have special rules for this one, the rules can instead be set for the whole app.

    This will also make sure that we don't get twice loading of everything; one for the application and then one
    for the servlet, since they both need the same stuff (database, services etc.)
