Momus
==========

> Momus or Momos (μῶμος) was in Greek mythology the personification of satire,
> mockery, censure; a god of writers and poets; a spirit of evil-spirited blame
> and unfair criticism. His name is related to μομφή, meaning 'blame' or 'censure'.
> He is depicted in classical art as lifting a mask from his face.

Momus is the successor to [Pegadi](https://github.com/dusken/pegadi), a java client and java server system for journalists.

Instead of the old and clunky java client, this uses AngularJS, making the system available for everyone without installation - for tablets and phones, even!
The backend is completely rewritten, using a newer version of Spring and the power of JPA.
